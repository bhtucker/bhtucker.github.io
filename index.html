<p>I'm Benson Tucker, a scientist, engineer, analyst, and architect of various things data. I've worked in real estate tech, bridging my past life as an urban studies student to my current life as a technologist, as well as in e-commerce SaaS, bringing real-time brand interactions to online retail with ChatID.

I spend my brain cycles on conditional probability, scaleable data products, and reformulating business problems through graphical models. I graduated with Latin and Greek honors from Brown University in 2013 and achieved a certificate in Data Science from Columbia Engineering School in 2015.</p>

<a id="on-this-site" class="anchor" href="#on-this-site" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On this Site</h3>

<p>My github projects touch on many topics I work on professionally and provide a glimpse into my own thinking and style. I've prioritized showing a range of my own work over providing any enterprise-ready solutions to these real world problems.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a rich marketing asset that is the ultimate in branded content. Someone a bit interested in the brand might react great, while someone totally uninterested might get spooked. The Ad Sim project models this situation. On one side, users browse (and potentially purchase) according to their hidden preferences about brands. On the other, an ad server tracks these users and tries to decide when an ad would be more likely to help than to hurt. Complete with conversion events and product prices, this sets up a whole real-time optimization and learning problem.
